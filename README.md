## Overview

HIcode is an impactful framework for code base structure designed to facilitate seamless code management and collaboration within and between teams (e.g., data science and data engineering teams). This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for python developers, outlining methodologies that simplify the process of adhering to essential principles: **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**, **KISS (Keep It Simple)**, **Consistency**, and **Testing**. Emphasizing best practices, the HIcode guideline aims to elevate code quality, readability, maintainability, and scalability within data science and engineering projects. The ultimate goal is to cultivate a more robust and sustainable agnostic software system that fosters productive co-working and maximizes project success.

## Get Started

To start leveraging the power of HIcode for your data science and engineering projects, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local environment using `git clone https://github.com/nmc-costa/HIcode.git`. 

2. **Setup the Repository**: Follow the [tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/nmc-costa/HIcode/blob/main/prototype/tutorial.ipynb) to setup and validate the conda environment.

3. **Explore the Guidelines**: Familiarize yourself with the comprehensive [guidelines](https://github.com/nmc-costa/HIcode/blob/main/HIcode_guidelines.md) outlined in the repository, covering DRY, KISS, Consistency, and Testing principles. Then, look into the [pipeline architecture](https://github.com/nmc-costa/HIcode/blob/main/HIcode_architecture.md) example.

4. **Apply the Principles**: Incorporate HIcode methodologies into your project development process to optimize code quality and collaboration by leveraging the base example provided in this repo.

5. **Contribute**: HIcode is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Share your insights and improvements to enhance the codebase further.

## Key Features

- **Empowering Collaboration**: HIcode bridges the gap between data teams (science and engineering), promoting seamless communication and enabling teams to work harmoniously towards common goals. Exemplification: by using python `def` to define the nomenclature (e.g., def load()) of subpipelines.  

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: By promoting code reuse and minimizing duplication, HIcode ensures a streamlined development process, reducing the risk of inconsistencies and errors. 

- **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Simplicity is key to maintainability and understanding. HIcode encourages developers to follow a straightforward approach in crafting elegant solutions. Examplification: by using [scikitlearn.Pipeline()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) to sequentially apply a list of transforms, creating classes of `fit` `transform` methods.

- **Consistency**: HIcode enforces consistent coding practices across the entire project, enhancing readability and making maintenance a breeze. Exemplification: by reusing the same pipeline structure throughout the project, we maintain consistent coding practices across the project.

- **Testing**: The HIcode framework enables robust testing methodologies, ensuring that code functions as expected and minimizing the potential for regressions. Examplification: by using a pipeline structure, each pipeline is tested and validated.

- **Agnostic**: HIcode structure with configurable pipelines enables a high level of data and sofware agnosticity, enabling developers to work on projects of any size and complexity with different packages. Exemplification: by using [scikitlearn.Pipeline()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) and metadata configurations.



## Benefits

- **Improved Code Quality**: HIcode encourages developers to adhere to best practices, resulting in cleaner, more efficient, and reliable code.

- **Enhanced Readability**: Consistent coding standards and documentation make the codebase easily understandable for all team members, facilitating knowledge transfer.

- **Greater Maintainability**: With DRY and KISS principles at its core, HIcode simplifies future changes and updates, reducing maintenance efforts.

- **Scalability**: HIcode is designed to handle project growth and complexity effectively, adapting to evolving requirements and scaling without complications.
